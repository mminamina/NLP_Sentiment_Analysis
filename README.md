## Natural Language Processing: Sentiment Analysis

### Overview
This repository contains my work on NLP Sentiment Analysis. The works are inspired from the great Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree. Please check out the link for details: https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch

I am not enrolled in Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree program; however, I have always been looking for ways to learn and experiment latest innovations through self-learning from diverse online resources.

### Worklist
- Notebook 1. NLP_SentimentAnalysis_RNN.ipynb (from Udacity DeepLearningND)
- Notebook 2. NLP_SentimentAnalysis_Keras.ipynb (private dataset)

Notebook_2 shows my own simple NLP implementation in Keras on Sentiment Analysis.
Problem Nature: Multi-Class text classification (Positive, Negative)
Model:  LSTM with embedding 
    
Packages Used

Python 3.6, NLTK, Pytorch, Keras, Sklearn
